# Angular-App

A webpage that allows users to search for congress information using the Sunlight Congress API. In this app, I have created a PHP script to return a JSON formatted data stream to the front-end. The client parses the JSON data and renders it in a nicer-looking, responsive UI (using Bootstrap). Technologies used are:

• AJAX, REST and JSON technologies
• A combination of HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, AngularJS and PHP
• Hosted on Elastic Beanstalk Amazon Web Services.
• Bootstrap to enhance the user experience
